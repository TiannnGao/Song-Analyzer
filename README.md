### Music Library Data Processor â€” SENG265 Software Development Methods

This project involves creating a command-line tool in C for processing and analyzing a music library dataset. The tool reads a CSV file containing track information, filters and sorts the data based on various fields, and outputs the results to a new CSV file. The program demonstrates proficiency in data parsing, linked list manipulation, and file I/O operations, handling tasks such as filtering by artist or playlist inclusion, and sorting tracks by streams or playlist appearances.

#### Key Features:

- **Data Parsing**: Efficiently parses a CSV file into a linked list of track information, handling fields such as track name, artist(s), release date, and stream counts.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Filters the dataset based on user-specified criteria (e.g., artist name or playlist inclusion) and sorts the results by streams or playlist counts, in ascending or descending order.
- **Output Generation**: Outputs the processed data to a new CSV file, allowing for easy analysis or reporting.

#### Skills Demonstrated:

- **C programming** with a focus on dynamic memory management using linked lists.
- **Command-line argument parsing** and data-driven program configuration.
- **File I/O operations** for reading and writing CSV data, showcasing the ability to handle real-world data formats efficiently.

This project highlights the ability to build data processing tools from scratch, working with structured data and implementing custom sorting and filtering logic.
